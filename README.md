- 👀 I’m interested in getting technical writing, reserach writing, creative writing, and communicating information to all types of audiences. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Git and Github for the means of documentation. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on a variety of different projects where people might need help with documentation.
